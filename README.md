# Health Insurance + AI-driven Wellness Project

## Project Summary
This website showcases a concept for a dynamic health insurance platform targeting young adults. It utilizes a modern, responsive design to explain the value proposition of integrating real-time wellness data with insurance premiums. The site features interactive elements, scroll animations, and a clean UI to effectively communicate the product's "win-win" economic model for users and insurers.

## Tech Stack & Frameworks
This project was built using a **No-Code/Low-Code** approach to ensure high-fidelity design and rapid prototyping. The core technologies include:

* **Framer**: Served as the primary visual development environment and site generator. It handles the responsive layout, breakpoints (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile), and publishing pipeline.
* **React**: The underlying library used by Framer to render the user interface components.
* **Framer Motion**: Used to power the animations (e.g., scroll reveals, entry effects) and interactions visible throughout the site.
* **HTML5/CSS3**: Custom CSS styling and HTML structure generated for web standards compliance.

## AI Tools Used
The following AI tools were utilized to enhance the design and development process:

* **Framer AI**: Assisted in generating initial layout structures, responsive text scaling, and color palette suggestions to speed up the visual design phase.
* **Google Gemini**: Used for code analysis to extract technical details for documentation, formatted the final submission files, and generated this technical README to meet assignment requirements.
