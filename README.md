# Lumina Care: AI-Driven Health Insurance Platform

## Project Overview
Lumina Care is a concept for a next-generation health insurance platform targeting young adults. The project demonstrates how dynamic pricing models can integrate with real-time wellness data. The website features a high-fidelity, interactive user interface designed to visually communicate the economic benefits of a "wellness-first" insurance model.

## Technical Architecture & Frameworks
This project website was developed using a modern frontend stack to achieve high-performance rendering and complex interactions:

* **React.js**: Served as the core component-based UI library for managing application state and DOM rendering.
* **Framer Motion**: Integrated for complex orchestration of animations, including scroll-triggered reveals, layout transitions, and gesture-based micro-interactions.
* **ES Modules & Rolldown**: Used for efficient bundling and optimizing runtime performance for production deployment.
* **Responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Utilized within the styling architecture to ensure seamless adaptability across varying device breakpoints.
* **Three.js / R3F (React Three Fiber)**: Utilized to implement the 3D visual elements and particle effects, adding depth and a futuristic aesthetic to the Figma prototype without compromising performance. 

## AI Tools Integration
To accelerate the design and asset creation pipeline, several AI tools were leveraged:

* **ChatGPT / Claude**: Assisted in generating the initial project boilerplate and debugging React component logic.
* **GitHub Copilot**: Utilized for code completion and optimizing CSS-in-JS syntax during the development process.
